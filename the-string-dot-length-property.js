/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
let stringThree = "";

// Your task: Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
let lengthOne = stringOne.length;   // Length of stringOne
let lengthTwo = stringTwo.length;   // Length of stringTwo
let lengthThree = stringThree.length; // Length of stringThree

// Your code here
console.log("There are " + lengthOne + " characters in " + stringOne); //There are 15 characters in Coding Bootcamp
console.log("There are " + lengthTwo + " characters in " + stringTwo);//There are 10 characters in JavaScript
console.log("There are " + lengthThree + " characters in " + stringThree);//There are 0 characters in
